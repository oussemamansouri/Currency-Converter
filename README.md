# Currency Converter

As part of my app development journey, this project represents one of my early attempts at building a **multi-layered application**.

The **Currency Converter** allows users to convert between three major currencies:

- Euro (EUR)  
- US Dollar (USD)  
- Tunisian Dinar (TND)

It was created to practice the fundamentals of user input handling, basic arithmetic operations, and layered application structure â€” all while building something practical and useful.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface  
- Real-time conversion between EUR, USD, and TND  
- Clean and modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension

## ðŸš€ Why This Project?

This project was one of my first steps into building more structured applications beyond basic UI, helping me understand how to separate concerns and organize code for better readability and scalability.

**More improvements and currency support may be added in the future. Stay tuned!**
